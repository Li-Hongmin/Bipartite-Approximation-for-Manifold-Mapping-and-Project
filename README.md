# Bipartite-Approximation-for-Manifold-Mapping-and-Project
A fast dimensionality reduction method.

I created this algorithm during my post doc at the University of Tokyo, Japan.

This work is inspired by the paper "Bipartite Approximation for Manifold Mapping and Projection" by Y. Wang, J. Li, and J. Han. The paper can be found [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220100269_Bipartite_Approximation_for_Manifold_Mapping_and_Projection).
